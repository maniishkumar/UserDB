# UserDB
This application will demonstrate how can we use **MongoDB** and **Node.js** to create an API.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Run/Execute application
```
node server.js
```
It will display you the port number on which server is listening. In this sample it is listening on 1338 so the URL to launch the applicaiton will be http://localhost:1338
